## Project Description

#### Grade Generator

    Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The
    input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the
    correct grade, as shown below:

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

#### Speed Detector

    Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    > For example, if the speed is 100, it should print: “Points: 6”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended” and if the speed is 70 and bellow, it should print: "Proper Driving!"
